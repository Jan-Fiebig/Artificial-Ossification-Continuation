# Artificial Ossification

A GhPython algorithm shape and size optimization that dynamically visualises ossification principles, including osteoblast and osteoclast movement.

# Setup

software requirements:

- Rhino 6 SR35 
- Karamba3D 1.3.3

# Usage

If you are unfamiliar with the algorithm, please explore the example files first.

- beam_divisions
- agent\_vision\_radius_factor
- agent\_effect\_radius_factor
- osteoblast_number
- osteoclast_number
- agent_strength
- iterations
- voronoi_divisions
- seed
